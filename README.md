# nasu.colorman.me

This is the repository for [nasu.colorman.me](https://nasu.colorman.me).  
The website has 2 main goals:

1. Be a list of all items in the [Nasuverse](https://typemoon.fandom.com/wiki/Nasuverse). Each item on the list can be checked off (e.g. "completed"), along with there being a direct download link to said items where it can be consumed.
2. Be an interactive timeline of the Nasuverse items, with multiple display-modes (e.g. chronological and release date).

Goal 1 is currently partly implemented and visible on the website. Goal 2 is still work in progress, but an older version is currently accessible on [thecolorman.github.io/Fate-Timeline](https://thecolorman.github.io/Fate-Timeline/). The repo for the timeline is also available: [github.com/TheColorman/Fate-Timeline](https://github.com/TheColorman/Fate-Timeline).

NOTE: None of the files available for download are hosted by me.
