Emulation and patching is legal, piracy is not. These instructions are for those who do not own a Nintendo Switch (you can still buy the game even if you do not own a Switch, at least you will be offsetting the piracy.)</i>\nFor more information, see the guides from <a href='https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx/wiki/Ryujinx-Setup-&-Configuration-Guide' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Ryujinx</a> and <a href='https://tsukihimates.com/patch/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Tsukihimates</a>.\nThe installation will most likely also work on Yuzu, though I have not tested it there.\n\n<strong>Installation instructions</strong>\n<ol style='list-style: decimal'><li>Download and extract the Ryujinx emulator.</li><li>Download the Prod Key and Firmware. Choose the newest version of both and make sure they match. Extract the Prod Key zip file (not the firmware one).</li><li>Follow the <a href='https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx/wiki/Ryujinx-Setup-&-Configuration-Guide#initial-setup---placement-of-prodkeys' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>key setup</a> for Ryujinx. Place both the <code>title.keys</code> and <code>prod.keys</code> files from the Prod Keys zip into the specified Ryujinx system folder.</li><li>Open up Ryujinx, go to Tools -> Install Firmware -> From XCI or ZIP. Navigate to and choose the Firmware zip you previously downloaded. It should display a success message after installation.</li><li>Download the Tsukihime NSP file. I recommend using MegaUp, as it's the fastest, but it will still take a while. (No need to download the v1.0.2 update.)\nThe website will download it in 5 parts. Once all 5 are downloaded, extract them to a folder (Note that some parts may be named incorrectly. If any of them ends in something like <code>part2_3</code>, remove the _3 part).\nIn Ryujinx, go to Options -> Settings. Here you need to add the path of the folder with the NSP file. See the <a href='https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx/wiki/Ryujinx-Setup-&-Configuration-Guide#adding-your-games-to-ryujinx' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Ryujinx guide</a> for more information. The Tsukihime game should now show up in the emulator.</li><li>Finally, download the English Patch by Tsukihimates. Instructions to apply it are on the download page.</li><li>You can now double-click the game to play it.</li></ol>",
