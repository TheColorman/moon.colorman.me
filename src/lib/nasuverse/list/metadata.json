Choose the newest version of both and make sure they match. Extract the Prod Key zip file (not the firmware one).</li><li>Follow the <a href='https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx/wiki/Ryujinx-Setup-&-Configuration-Guide#initial-setup---placement-of-prodkeys' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>key setup</a> for Ryujinx. Place both the <code>title.keys</code> and <code>prod.keys</code> files from the Prod Keys zip into the specified Ryujinx system folder.</li><li>Open up Ryujinx, go to Tools -> Install Firmware -> From XCI or ZIP. Navigate to and choose the Firmware zip you previously downloaded. It should display a success message after installation.</li><li>Download the Tsukihime NSP file. I recommend using MegaUp, as it's the fastest, but it will still take a while. (No need to download the v1.0.2 update.)\nThe website will download it in 5 parts. Once all 5 are downloaded, extract them to a folder (Note that some parts may be named incorrectly. If any of them ends in something like <code>part2_3</code>, remove the _3 part).\nIn Ryujinx, go to Options -> Settings. Here you need to add the path of the folder with the NSP file. See the <a href='https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx/wiki/Ryujinx-Setup-&-Configuration-Guide#adding-your-games-to-ryujinx' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Ryujinx guide</a> for more information. The Tsukihime game should now show up in the emulator.</li><li>Finally, download the English Patch by Tsukihimates. Instructions to apply it are on the download page.</li><li>You can now double-click the game to play it.</li></ol>",
